This gui was created specifically for Windows, though it might work for linux as well. It was designed using Python27 and cygwin, any other configuration may not work.

The easiest way to get it to work is to have cygwin/bin in the windows PATH, and make sure cygwin has GCC. Then, in windows, open GUI.py with python.exe in the Python27 directory in Program Files.
